- What are your initial impressions of how `Association` affectes your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
My intial impressions are that you have to make sure what terminology you are using to call open other classes you have created. Additionally, you have to know how the call stack works and where your pointers lead to. What worked was having my class notes out while completing this assignment. I recommend working with a partner too. By pair programming I was able to catch bugs before we even came across from them. We made sure to go to TA hours and solve the issues we faced while trying to finish the assignment. 
I worked with Gracia B, Renee OP
